#Image Enhancement using CNN

The human visual perception of an image can be greatly affected by the contrast of an image. 
Contrast is defined as the difference in the pixel intensity value of a particular pixel 
to its neighbouring pixels. If the difference in the intensity is more, then
we can say that the contrast is more of that image. 


Image enhancement is a technique used to get a better quality of an image in terms of its clarity, 
brightness and to give the human eye comfortable to look at Global image contrast enhancement is one of 
the most effectively used technique to enhance the quality of an image.

First, the image is locally enhanced and the output is again processed by the global enhancement method
thereby giving a properly enhanced image without losing the brightness of the image.
